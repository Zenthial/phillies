This implements the qualifying offer calculations in Rust.

## Online REPL
If you're just looking to run the code without installing anything, here is a link to an online REPL that can execute Rust code in the browser: https://www.rustexplorer.com/b/4lpqfp

## Building the Code
If you want to build the code yourself:
- Clone this code to your machine
- Ensure you have Rust installed (can install the toolchain here: https://rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Navigate into the clone'd repository and run `cargo run` which will compile and run the code

## About the dependencies used
I use three different crates to make this project work:
- num_format: formats integers in a standard language based format
- ureq: lightweight library to make http requests with
- scraper: html parsing library
